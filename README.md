# GAME TIME
********************

### Description

Given the list of three games (Jeopardy, Family Feud, and Wheel of Fortune), our group was assigned with the task of recreating Jeopardy; Our theme is Tron. The end goal was to successfully execute a fetch request that sends and receives data, while having a fully functional game that was heavily based on the principles of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). There are several classes that make up the entire game, and for the game to actually work, these classes have to communicate with each other.

### Languages

- CSS/SCSS
